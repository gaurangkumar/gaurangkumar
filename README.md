Welcome to my profile! This really has a MySpace feel to it, doesn't it? I wonder if I can set up some background tunes ðŸ¤”.

I'm mainly a PHP developer. Most of my work on GitHub is on **[IronPHP Framework](https://github.com/ironphp/ironphp)**, a personal finance manager, and the associated tools.

But also interesting are the following tools that you might find useful:

1. [TicTacToe](https://github.com/gaurangkumar/tictactoe). A two player TicTacToe online game.
1. [CodeWork](https://github.com/gaurangkumar/codework). Freelancer management website.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IronPHP Framework
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ironphp
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- âš¡ Fun fact: Besides coding I spend my time in Gaming, Physics, Discovery channel.

Also, as you can see in the bottom left corner, you can sponsore me for the work I do on IronPHP. I'm very proud to have such a nice group of people willing to support me.
Thank you!
